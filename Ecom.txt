how to build simple online jewellery platform something like meesho?

I want to use React + Node, Please give detailed steps for building online jewellery app?

Cool, let’s turn “React + Node jewellery app” into a concrete, step-by-step plan you can actually execute.

I’ll assume:

Frontend: React (with React Router)

Backend: Node.js + Express

DB: MongoDB (via Mongoose)

Auth: JWT (email/password)

Payments: Razorpay / Stripe (conceptual steps)

You can swap pieces later, but this gives you a solid default.

0. Prerequisites

Make sure you have:

Node.js + npm

MongoDB (Atlas cloud or local)

A code editor (VS Code)

Basic knowledge of JS, React, Node, HTTP

I've integrated Razorpay! You can now select "Online Payment (Razorpay)" at checkout.

Important: I've added placeholder keys to your .env file. You need to replace them with your actual Razorpay Test Key ID and Secret for payments to work.

File: server/.env


I see the PowerShell execution policy issue again. Let me work around this by creating the components first and documenting the npm install command for you to run manually:


Emails Not Sending?
Check your server console for "Failed to send email notification" errors.
Ensure you have added the following to your .env file:
EMAIL_SERVICE=gmail
EMAIL_USERNAME=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-specific-password
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin-email@example.com



Important: Please make sure you have added your Razorpay Test Keys to server/.env file. RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=rzp_test_... RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=...

You can now test the payment flow by selecting "Online Payment (Razorpay)" at checkout.
