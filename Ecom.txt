how to build simple online jewellery platform something like meesho?

I want to use React + Node, Please give detailed steps for building online jewellery app?

Cool, let’s turn “React + Node jewellery app” into a concrete, step-by-step plan you can actually execute.

I’ll assume:

Frontend: React (with React Router)

Backend: Node.js + Express

DB: MongoDB (via Mongoose)

Auth: JWT (email/password)

Payments: Razorpay / Stripe (conceptual steps)

You can swap pieces later, but this gives you a solid default.

0. Prerequisites

Make sure you have:

Node.js + npm

MongoDB (Atlas cloud or local)

A code editor (VS Code)

Basic knowledge of JS, React, Node, HTTP

I've integrated Razorpay! You can now select "Online Payment (Razorpay)" at checkout.

Important: I've added placeholder keys to your .env file. You need to replace them with your actual Razorpay Test Key ID and Secret for payments to work.

File: server/.env


I see the PowerShell execution policy issue again. Let me work around this by creating the components first and documenting the npm install command for you to run manually:


Emails Not Sending?
Check your server console for "Failed to send email notification" errors.
Ensure you have added the following to your .env file:
EMAIL_SERVICE=gmail
EMAIL_USERNAME=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-specific-password
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin-email@example.com



Important: Please make sure you have added your Razorpay Test Keys to server/.env file. RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=rzp_test_... RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=...

You can now test the payment flow by selecting "Online Payment (Razorpay)" at checkout.


there is some issue in the pincode implementation logic
if pincode from which the user is trying to place order is not "serviceable" or "out of stock" area
then notify the user with message when the user enters pincode and still the user must be able to add items to the wishlist or add to cart for future reference
and if the area is serceable and stock is available then send notifications using whatsapp, mail and messages or even push notifications if possible
but "try at home" must be disabled if entered pincode is not "serviceable" or "out of stock" area and notify the user when stock available again in the particular area

order id - 6933c277754f0562175d6936, return completted but stock still showing 8 actually it should be 9....could you please help me to fix the issue?


still some improvements can be made
1. change password text is not clearly visible
2. width of the all the panels like dashboard header and other panels is more.....design will be good if we reduce it a bit
3.spacing between different headers is still more......design will be good if we reduce it a bit

Can you make these enhancements to make our platform the best indian jewellery sector

1. Categories in header.
